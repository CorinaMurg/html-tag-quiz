# About HTML Tag Quiz

In order to become an Accessibility Developer you should know as many semantic HTML tags as possible. Let's check how many you actually know.

**Note:** Merge reviews are done every Saturday. ðŸ˜‡

## Design of the app

Please go to the <a href="https://github.com/YurisCodingClub/html-tag-quiz/discussions/">discussions section of the project</a> where I opened a discussion about the app's design and work together on a great design for the app.

### CodeNewbies

If you are a complete beginner in open source / GitHub, don't worry. Look at the following description on how to set up the project locally.

If you are a complete beginner in coding or open source, don't worry. Let's start with the following: Look up what semantic HTML means. Think about what a navigation actually is (a list of links). Use the corresponding semantic HTML for it. You can find everything needed to fulfill this issue by looking the terms up in w3schools or MDN. If these sites are new to you, don't worry. You will get used to them over time. Happy coding ðŸ™‚

### Prerequisites

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10xHPRthNMKP8vi_mS8KjklhlLIhVlp6g" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal, go to the directory where you want the project to be saved and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/dev-cv.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the dev-cv repository on GitHub to your computer.

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd dev-cv
```

Open the project in Visual Studio Code (or your favorite code editor):

```
code .
```

Run the project:

Right click on the `index.html` file and choose

```
Open with Live Server
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout -b` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b name-of-issue
```

### Make necessary changes and commit those changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add filename
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Name of issue"
```

#### Commit message

There are different ways of writing a commit message. For more reference checkout the
article about [How to write a good commit message](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21).

For this project we are going to use following style:

**type-of-issue- + number-of-issue[action you took]**

Practical example:

`feature-11[Fix typo in README.md]`

### Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin -u <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1FMXVHEhxBxeSFWsJsR53ddE8GmyAlMR4" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1r6VFuraC-5l9PF4JKn9A4Rhmm-4VelI7" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

Have fun ðŸ‘»!
